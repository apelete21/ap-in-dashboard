            The best time to visit Japan is generally considered to be between
            March and May, or October and November. However, it depends on your
            interests and what you're planning to do during your trip. While
            many travelers prefer to avoid the heat and humidity of summer, or
            cold of winter, you might be an exception if you're interested in
            summer matsuri (festivals) or winter onsen (hot springs), skiing,
            and snowboarding.
